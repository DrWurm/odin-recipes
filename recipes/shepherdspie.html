        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Move over, lemon meringue. Hit the road, key lime! Hasta la vista, pumpkin. Here at EP, we’re alllllll about meat in our pies. Yep, we’re talkin’ turkey. And forget about that fussy crust, because this right here is a shepherd’s pie. That means instead of a rolling out dough we’re spreading creamy mashed potatoes over the hearty turkey filling like a warm, cozy blanket. Can your whipped cream do THAT!?</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>10 oz Ground Turkey</li>
                <li>2 Tbs Sour Cream</li>
                <li>4 Tbs Chicken Stock Concentrate</li>
                <li>1 Large Carrot</li>
                <li>1 Large Celery Stalk</li>
                <li>12 oz Potatoes</li>
                <li>1 tsp Dried Thyme</li>
                <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
                <li>2 Cloves Garlic</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and dry produce. Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Peel garlic. Finely chop one clove (two cloves for 4 servings); keep remaining garlic whole. Trim, peel, and finely dice carrot. Finely dice celery. Halve, peel, and finely dice half the onion.</li>
                <li>Place potatoes and whole garlic in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, 10-12 minutes. Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes and garlic to pot. Keep covered off heat until ready to mash.</li>
                <li>While potatoes and garlic cook, heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add carrot and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add celery, diced onion, and a large drizzle of oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until veggies are just tender, 5-7 minutes. Stir in chopped garlic and half the dried thyme. Cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add turkey to pan with veggies and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Stir in 1 TBSP butter until melted, then sprinkle with 2 TBSP flour. Cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slowly pour ¾ cup plain water into pan, stirring, until thoroughly combined. Stir in stock concentrates and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, 2-3 minutes. (If mixture is too thick, stir in a splash more water.) Meanwhile, mash potatoes and whole garlic with sour cream and 3 TBSP butter until smooth, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid (or milk, for extra creaminess) as needed. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Spread mashed potatoes on top of turkey mixture, leaving a 1-inch gap around edge of pan. Divide between plates. <strong><em>Ground Turkey is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°.</strong></em></li>
            </ol>
