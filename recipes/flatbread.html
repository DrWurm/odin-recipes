        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Dear Roasted Bell Pepper Flatbread, OMG, we don’t even know where to start. So many great times this year. Remember when you were just a crispy crust?? We knew you were great then, but now you’re SO decked out! You totally deserved the Toppings Queen crown at the Sadie Top’ins Dance! Ugh, we know we said we were going to focus more on what’s on the inside, but... bell pepper, onion, creamy tomato sauce, and melty mozz just can't be topped.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Flatbreads</li>
                <li>2 Tbs Tuscan Heat Spice/li>
                <li>1 Red Bell Pepper</li>
                <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
                <li>1 Large Celery Stalk</li>
                <li>3 Tbs Tomato Paste</li>
                <li>2 Tbs Cream Cheese/li>
                <li>1 Cup Shredded Mozzarella</li>
                <li>2 Cloves Garlic</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion into wedges. Halve, core, and thinly slice bell pepper into strips. Peel and finely chop garlic.</li>
                <li>Toss onion and bell pepper on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, half the Tuscan Heat Spice (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until softened and lightly browned, 13-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>While veggies roast, rub tops of each flatbread with a drizzle of olive oil. Place on a second baking sheet; toast on middle rack until golden and crispy at the edges, 5-7 minutes. </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 TBSP butter in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and remaining Tuscan Heat Spice; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste until incorporated. Stir in cream cheese and ⅓ cup water until combined. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, 2-3 minutes. Remove pan from heat; season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Once flatbreads are golden and crispy at the edges, remove from oven. Carefully spread with sauce and top with as many roasted veggies as you like. Sprinkle with mozzarella. Return flatbreads to oven until cheese melts, 3-5 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Slice flatbreads into pieces and divide between plates.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
